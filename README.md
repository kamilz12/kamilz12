I'm a Computer Science student with a strong interest in **backend development**, particularly in **.NET technologies**. I'm focused on building reliable and efficient backend systems, continuously improving my skills in:

- 💪 **C#**, **ASP.NET**, **ASP.NET Core**
- 🗄️ **Entity Framework**, **SQL**
- 🌐 **REST API**, **MVC**
- 🖥️ **Blazor** - Building modern web applications

📚 I occasionally work with **Java**, **Python**, and **JavaScript** to broaden my skill set and enhance my problem-solving abilities. I'm also interested in **cybersecurity**, which provides me with new inspirations for learning and experimenting.
